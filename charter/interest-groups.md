# Interest Groups
Interest groups are a mechanism in Electron governance that allow individuals to provide input into specific categories of Electron development.  The intention would be that these groups would provide for better reviews of electron PRs.

## Possible Interest Groups
* APIs
* Node/V8 
* New Chromium feature implementation (eg push notifications)

## Membership
Membership into interest groups are open to anyone in the Electron Maintainers group in good standing.

## Interest Group Workflow
1. When a PR affects one or more interest categories the submitter of the PR or a reviewer of a PR assigns the appropriate interest group teams as reviewer(s) for the PR.
2. Members of interest groups will be notified via GitHub notifications when a PR has a reviewer set to the interest group teams that member belongs to.
3. Interest group members provide feedback using the GitHub PR review process.
4. If there are conflicting opinions on the PR, the reviewers involved should seek to resolve the conflicts within the PR.
5. If resolution cannot be agreed upon in the PR the issue can be raised for resolution with the following responsibility chain:
    1. The disagreement should first be raised at the appropriate working group (if applicable).  
    2. If the working group cannot agree or if there isn't an applicable working group, the issue is then raised for resolution by the directors of the working groups.  
    3. If the directors of the working groups cannot agree, the issue is then elevated to the admin working group.
