## Agenda

* Electron On Arm? Which version should it go into? `6-1-x`, `6-0-x`, `7-0-x`?
    * https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/19391
    * resolution: @MarshallOfSound and/or @jkleinsc will modify the patch to apply only on arm and it will ship in a `6-0-x` release; no new `6-1-x` branch
* (@codebytere) Should this WG own [`chromedriver`](https://github.com/electron/chromedriver)?
    * (And [`mksnapshot`](https://github.com/electron/mksnapshot))?
    * **Verdict:** YES, we should own `chromedriver` and `mksnapshot`
