## Agenda

1. `5.0.0-beta.6` release. It's been 15 days since the last beta release
    * **Verdict:** this is done.
2. Electron/Chromium release schedule coordination
    * **Verdict:** formalize a 12 week release cycle
3. What should we do about the bugs in [`4-0-x`](https://github.com/orgs/electron/projects/17 ) now that the line is deprecated and we are not maintaining?
    * 4-1-x bugs are the exact same, it's the same branch with a few extra things on it
    * **Verdict:** Rename `4-0-x` label to `4-1-x` and the `4-0-x` board to `4-1-x`.

## Action Items

* Formalize a 12-week release schedule and update versioning document with it (@MarshallOfSound)
