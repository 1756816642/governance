## Agenda
* (@sofianguy) Let's talk about moving our policy for accepting semver-minor BPs to end of Week 2. Right now it is end of Week 3.
    * ref current schedule: https://github.com/electron/governance/blob/master/wg-releases/major-version-release-schedule.md
    * Verdict: from v8 and on, releases wg will accept semver-minor BPs (with good reason, of course) during the Releases WG meeting of Week 3. No changes to v7. If a BP request comes up this week, we will vote async.
    * Need to update these docs:
        * https://github.com/electron/governance/tree/master/wg-releases#feature-backport-requests-for-major-versions-in-beta
        * https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/electron-versioning.md#beta-releases-and-bug-fixes

## Backport Requests

**Nota Bene:** If you are the requester, you are generally expected to attend the meeting. If you are unable to do so, please state your reason for requesting the backport. The PR in question must be _targeting_ the desired branch at the time of request.
