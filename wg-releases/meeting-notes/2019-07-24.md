## Agenda

* Electron On Arm?
    * `6-1-x`?
    * `6-0-x` post initial release?
    * `7-0-x`?
    * Arm folks have the Windows on Arm work done but have not moved it to 6-0-x _yet_
    * Do we release an unsupported version?
    * [john] definitely not ready for initial 6.0.0 release and we do not want to say that it is a supported version.
    * [sam] Do we have infrastructure to release Arm?
        * [John] Yes, we should
    * We should find out Arm's timeline for their ship and decide in the next meeting when we should release. It will definitely not go into 6.0.0 or 7.0.0-beta.1 release.
        * John to follow up with them
