## Agenda
1. Backports
    - feat: add `process.getSystemVersion()` (backport: 5-0-x) [#17141](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17141)

    - discussion of what the policy for backporting semver-minor features to active beta cycles
        - should there be a point during the beta cycle beyond which we no longer accept semver-minor?
            - no
            - the bar for accepting semver-minor backports should be that there's a good justification (as determined by the releases wg)

2. suggestion to move the start of this meeting earlier by 15 minutes, to give extra time in case of spillover
    - sounds good

3. What's the goal for how long master -> stable should be? Chrome is ~12 weeks, should we match that?
    - https://github.com/electron/roller/pull/8#issuecomment-467996465
    - should we speed up releases? how long should it be from master -> stable? how long should it be between stable releases?
    - charles and shelley mention that people seem to be happy with the 12-week cadence
    - if we change it, we should consult with AFP
    - actually the release time we care about is Chrome stable -> Electron stable, not Electron master -> Electron stable
    - Should we match Chrome's release schedule?
    - General agreement that we should aim to match Chrome's release structure (canary / dev / beta / stable)
    - this would mean a fairly major change to our versioning structure
    - ACTION: keep talking about it :)

Didn't get to:
- npm module organization
    - `electron` vs `electron-nightly`
- Process of adding new Releases WG members 

## Follow-Up

- Should our release schedule match Chromium's?
