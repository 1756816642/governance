## Areas of Responsibility

* Review and unblocks API PRs in a timely way.
* Resolve API disagreements.
* Define the process for which API changes are reviewed and approved.
* Create initiatives to develop/modify/change API implementations.
* Increase participation with web standards groups.

## Changing API

1. Contributors should follow the [best practices guide](./best-practices.md) when applicable.
1. When creating change issues / PRs, contributors should mention `@wg-api` in the description and request review from `wg-api`.
1. WG members should watch for these notifications and give review in a timely manner.
1. Ideally, this will be enough! :rocket:

If consensus isn't reached on a PR, an interested party should add the PR's URL to the WG's next meeting agenda:

* If the PR needs reviewers, the WG will find volunteers to review.
* If the PR needs consensus, the WG will resolve the issue by majority vote. Votes should be made in consideration of the [best practices guide](./best-practices.md).
* WG members should read the meeting agenda _in advance_ to be able to unblock PRs in a well-informed way.
* Members unable to attend a meeting's vote may submit their vote to the Chair prior to the meeting.

## Joining the API WG

In order to become formal members of the WG, prospective members must:

1. be actively contributing to the work of the WG,
1. attend 2 out of 4 consecutive meetings, and
1. be approved by a 2/3rds majority of current WG members (rounded up).
    1. The prospective member shall leave the meeting during the deliberation and vote.
    1. The meeting notes shall contain only the outcome of the vote (approved/not approved), not the individual votes.
    1. Members not able to attend the meeting at which the vote occurs may submit their vote to the Chair prior to the meeting.

If you're interested in joining the API Working Group, reach out to an [existing member](#Membership) and ask to be invited to the regular meeting and as a guest to the #wg-api channel in Slack.

### Actively contributing

"Actively contributing" doesn't necessarily mean writing code. It does mean that you should be in regular communication with the API WG (including attending meetings), and it does mean that you should be materially contributing to the project in some way. If you're not sure whether the work you're doing counts as "materially contributing", reach out to a [member](#Membership) and ask. ðŸ™‚

### Timezones

The API WG currently meets at alternating times to accommodate the timezone constraints of the members.
